# 🕵️‍♂️ Ambient Manufactured Consent Detector

An advanced multi-agent pipeline built with **Google ADK 2.0 (Agent Development Kit)** designed to detect manufactured consent, state-backed propaganda, and foreign NGO influence in media articles, blogs, and YouTube video transcripts.

The pipeline utilizes a graph-based **Workflow** architecture to dynamically route articles to specialized geopolitical context analysts depending on the target region or language of the text.

## 🛠️ Requirements & Setup

Before running the project, make sure you have:
1. **uv**: Python package manager - [Install Guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
2. **agents-cli**: Google Agents CLI - Install with:
   ```bash
   uv tool install google-agents-cli
   ```
3. **Gemini API Key**: Set your key in a `.env` file at the root of the project:
   ```env
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```

## 🚀 Quick Start / Development Commands

We provide a `Makefile` with standard workflows for local setup, execution, testing, and linting:

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `make install` | Create virtual environment (`.venv`) and install all package dependencies via `uv sync` |
| `make run` | Launch the Streamlit dashboard on `http://localhost:8501` |
| `make eval` | Run the local multi-agent evaluation suite using LLM-as-judge grading |
| `make playground` | Launch the interactive local ADK CLI agent playground |
| `make lint` | Check code quality using Ruff |
| `make clean` | Remove `.venv`, `__pycache__`, and temp caches |

## 🧠 Workflow Architecture & Agent Pipeline

The detector operates on a graph-based **Workflow** containing the following nodes:

```mermaid
graph TD
    START --> scraper[📥 Scraper Agent]
    scraper --> translator[🗣️ Translation Agent]
    translator --> researcher[🔍 Research Agent]
    researcher --> router{🧭 Context Router}
    
    router -- "Sri Lankan Content" --> sl_specialist[🇱🇰 Sri Lankan Context Specialist]
    router -- "Russian Content" --> ru_specialist[🇷🇺 Russian Context Specialist]
    router -- "Other / General" --> gen_specialist[🌍 Generic Context Specialist]
    
    sl_specialist --> analyzer[📊 Analysis Agent]
    ru_specialist --> analyzer
    gen_specialist --> analyzer
    
    analyzer --> END[Manufactured Consent Index Report]
```

### 1. Ingestion & Processing
*   **Scraper Agent**: Automatically extracts article text or extracts transcripts directly from YouTube URLs.
*   **Translation Agent**: Preserves original framing, metaphors, and tone while translating non-English content to English.
*   **Research Agent**: Identifies entities (think tanks, politicians, NGOs) and runs real-time **Google Search grounding** to unearth backing and funding history.

### 2. Geopolitical Routing & Context Specialists
*   **Context Router**: A classification node that uses the base model to direct the article to the appropriate context specialist.
*   **Sri Lankan Context Specialist**: Focuses on domestic Sri Lankan political histories, election dynamics, local partisan groups, and NGO networks.
*   **Russian Context Specialist**: Highlights Kremlin foreign policy, state-backed media networks (RT, Sputnik), and proxy/information-warfare techniques.
*   **Generic Context Specialist**: Handles general international media topics.

### 3. Synthesis & Attributions
*   **Analysis Agent**: Integrates findings, computes sub-scores, lists detected actors and propaganda techniques, and outputs the final **Manufactured Consent Index (MCI)** report.

## 📊 Evaluation & Verification

The evaluation suite tests the workflow across 6 different scenarios covering organic local news, state propaganda, foreign NGO policy pushes, generic US debates, Sri Lankan provincial updates, and international YouTube commentary.

To execute the verification suite:
```bash
make eval
```

It runs inferences, grades results via the LLM-as-judge rubric, and displays a summary verdict scorecard.
